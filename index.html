        <p class="me">
          My biggest interest is in creativity. I would like to create stuff
          that is in 3d art and in video gaming. I always like to entertain
          people and make them laugh. I do well in school and want to persue in
          technology. I find my interest in art, it feels like I want to go and
          create amazing things just for fun.

          I am currently going to Rauner College Prep. Over the time I would
          take all AP classes for college, attend code nation to learn how to
          make websites using HTML, Jquery and CSS. At my free time I want to
          dedicate on what I love - to learn how to do 3d art using the blender
          engine. In the mere future I would want to be working in the tech area
          and make video games and 3d art as a hobby for fun.
